## Overview

This repository contains research examining the growing collision between political polarization in the United States, algorithmic media ecosystems, and their effects on economic governance. The project explores how algorithm-driven platforms create echo chambers that amplify partisan divides and distort economic perceptions.

## üìë Key Topics Covered

- **Political Polarization**: Analysis of the deepening partisan divide in the US and how it extends beyond policy disagreements to intense negative feelings toward opposing parties.
  
- **Algorithmic Media Ecosystems**: How digital platforms use algorithms to personalize content, reinforcing ideological divides and creating filter bubbles.
  
- **Economic Misperceptions**: How partisan echo chambers distort Americans' perceptions of economic conditions, with evidence showing partisanship often predicts economic perception better than actual economic performance.
  
- **Social Stability Risks**: Research on how polarized, algorithm-driven misinformation can contribute to real-world harms, including political violence.
